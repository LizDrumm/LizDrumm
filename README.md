Welcome to my Github page! I am currently in the Labs portion of Lambda School, nearing the end of my time in the Full Stack Web Development track and looking forward to joining the working world! Currently working on Story Squad, a React web application that turns reluctant readers (ages 8-12) into authors and illustrators through fun, competitive face-offs.
